## larger datsets

This directory contains datasets not formally included with the *nmrrr* package due to size constraints, 
but made available to users as practice datasets for different solvents/nuclei.



| dataset name     | nuclei           | solvent            | notes            |
|------------------|------------------|--------------------|------------------|
| amp_tempest | 1H               | MeOD               | Soil extracts with seawater, using soil samples collected from the TEMPEST ecosystem manipulation experiment ([Hopple et al. 2023](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10661-022-10807-0)). Soil extracts were generated using seawater and cleaned/concentrated by solid phase extraction, eluted using methanol. Raw data were processed in MNova. |
| kfp_drydown  | 1H               | D2O                | Soil samples from Alaska and Washington (USA) were subjected to drought. Soil water extracts were freeze-dried and reconstituted in D2O for 1H NMR. Raw data were processed in MNova. |
| meb_sierra     | 31P              | NaOH + EDTA + MeOD | Data obtained from [Barnes 2020](https://escholarship.org/uc/item/1fr2r9h9). Soil samples were collected from the Sierra Nevada (A horizon). Samples were extracted using 0.25 M NaOH and 0.05 M Na2EDTA (1:10 v/v), freeze-dried, and reconstituted in 1.08 mL of a 1.0 M NaOH and 0.05 M EDTA solution plus 0.12 mL of D2O. Reconstituted samples were spiked with MDP. Raw data were processed in MNova |
| meb_char       | 31P              | NaOH + EDTA + MeOD | Vegetation samples were collected across Washington and Oregon, USA and then experimentally burnt in an open-air burn table. Samples were extracted using 0.25 M NaOH and 0.05 M Na2EDTA (1:20 v/v), freeze-dried, and reconstituted in 0.52 mL of D2O, 0.52 mL of 0.5 M NaOH with 0.1 M EDTA, and 0.26 mL of 10 M NaOH. |
