## larger datsets

This directory contains datasets not formally included with the *nmrrr* package due to size constraints, 
but made available to users as practice datasets for different solvents/nuclei.



| dataset name     | nuclei           | solvent            | notes            |

| amp_tempest_MeOH | 1H               | MeOD               | Soil extracts with seawater, using soil samples collected from the TEMPEST ecosystem manipulation experiment ([Hopple et al. 2023](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10661-022-10807-0)). Raw data were processed in MNova. |
| kfp_drydown_D2O  | 1H               | D2O                | Soil water extracts reconstituted in D2O, using soil samples collected from Alaska and Washington, USA. Investigating the effects of drought duration on soil carbon dynamics. Raw data were processed in MNova. |
| meb_sierra_P     | 31P              | NaOH + EDTA + MeOD | Data obtained from [Barnes 2020](https://escholarship.org/uc/item/1fr2r9h9). Soil samples were collected from the Sierra Navada (A horizon). Raw data were processed in MNova |
