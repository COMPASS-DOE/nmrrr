This package contains three example datasets:
1. kfp_hysteresis
1. amp_tempest
1. meb_burn

These are much smaller subsets of larger datasets generated as part of larger experiments.


## `kfp_hysteresis` dataset

This dataset contains six samples from Patel et al. 2021.
Samples 26-30 represent a drought treatment, and samples 31-35 represent a flood treatment.
