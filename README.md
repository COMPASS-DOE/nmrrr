# nmrrr

An R package for batch processing and analysis of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) results.

This package is designed for batch processing and analysis of **NMR** results in **R** (nmrrr).

Use this package for:  
(a) plotting spectra  
(b) calculating relative abundance of functional groups  
(c) peak assignments

Before using this package, NMR spectra must be processed in MestreNova
(phase corrected, baseline corrected, deconvoluted, peak picked,
normalized).
